            <p>I am a human being that is likely living on the same planet as you, so be careful out there! I am a big fan of eating and consuming food for the purpose of gaining energy and can often be found doing such at any uncertain time on any given day. I also walk occasionally as a means of transportation over short distances, but do not expect to catch me practicing this.</p>
            <p>In my free time I often enjoy resting so that my false humanoid skin.. I mean so that I am prepared and energized for anything that may happen in the day. I posess few skills and even fewer remarkable attributes that may not be found as useful, so if this interests you, dear reader, please feel free to carry on to the "Contact Me" page! </p>
